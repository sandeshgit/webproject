# Web Development Project

## Overview
This is a crash course in web development. The person taking this course is assumed to have some basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Databases, MySQL, and PHP.
The objective of the project is to help professionals, as well as students, start/boost their careers in Web Development. We will be working on a web project from scratch(brainstorming ideas) to completing it and hosting it online.

## Outline
1. Brainstorming
1. Backend database architecture
1. Frontend (Static) Outline
1. Git and Github
1. Outline to Static HTML and CSS.
1. Responsive Design and Media Queries.
1. Javascript or jQuery?
1. Regular CSS or Bootstrap or Tailwind-CSS?
1. AMP installation
1. Static to Dynamic Conversion

## 1. Brainstorming
The first step is coming up with possible project ideas and finalizing one. There are hundreds of possible projects we can get started with. However, we will choose one where we can enhance both Backend and  Frontend skills. A project which involves:
  * **Relational Database**: Tables creation in MySQL.
  * **CRUD**: CRUD operations.
  * **Backend Logic**: that can be implemented on PHP.
  * **Javascript**: Some Dynamic Interaction on the Frontend.
  * **Ajax**: Data sharing between Frontend and Backend.

Some possible project ideas are:
  1. Students Management System
  2. News Portal
  3. Todo List
  4. Online Food Ordering System
  5. Twitter Clone
  6. College Social Network
  7. Real State Website
  8. Library Management System







## 2. AMP installation
Apache, MySQL/MariaDB and PHP installation. It can either be XAMPP or LAMP.

## 3. Backend database architecture
Getting started with ER Diagram after finalizing entities of the project.

## 4. Frontend (Static) Outline
The interface of the project will be designed at this step.

## 5. Outline to Static HTML
Converting the outline into a static web application in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## 6. Javascript vs jQuery
The students will be given a brief introduction to Javascript and jQuery so they can decide which one they are going to use in their project.

## 7. Git and Github
Getting started with the Version Control System. This step involves Git installation on the local system and account creation at Github.
Then the code will be committed and pushed to Github on a regular basis.

## 8. Static to Dynamic Conversion
This is the major step of the project where students will gain experience as well as utilize existing programming knowledge. All the functionalities in the static web application will actually be implemented here. After creating the tables in MySQL, the application will be connected to the database using PHP. The application can be made even more user friendly using AJAX.
